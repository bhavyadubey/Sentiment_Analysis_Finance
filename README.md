The Above Figure Counts the Positive , negative ,Neutral Tweets of Nifty50 stock observed for 5 days.
In this project I investigated the sentiment of online tweets. I used a combination of different pre-processing methods to reduce 
the noise in the text. I have used LSTM model with 3 inner layers. We have reported extensive experimental results, showing 
that, if the values of parameters which are used in LSTM model and  the model training purpose. An accuracy of 63.62% was achieved 
and overall a weighted average F1 score of 0.64 is obtained.
